## 1. Introduction to SQL and Relational Databases

### What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It allows you to create, read, update, and delete data.

### Relational Database Concepts

- **Tables**: Store data in rows and columns.
- **Rows (Records)**: Individual entries in a table.
- **Columns (Fields)**: Attributes of the data.
- **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
- **Foreign Key**: A field in one table that links to the primary key in another table.
- **Relationships**: Logical connections between tables.

### Types of Relationships

- **One-to-One (1:1)**: A single record in one table is related to a single record in another.
- **One-to-Many (1:N)**: A single record in one table is related to multiple records in another.
- **Many-to-Many (M:N)**: Multiple records in one table are related to multiple records in another.

#### Diagram Representation

```mermaid
erDiagram
    TableA ||--|| TableB : One-to-One
    TableC ||--o{ TableD : One-to-Many
    TableE }o--o{ TableF : Many-to-Many
```

---

## 2. Data Definition Language (DDL)

DDL commands define and modify the structure of the database and its objects.

### 2.1 Creating Databases

#### Syntax

```sql
CREATE DATABASE database_name;
```

#### Example

```sql
CREATE DATABASE CompanyDB;
```

---

### 2.2 Creating Tables with Relationships

#### Defining Tables and Relationships

When creating tables, defining relationships involves specifying primary keys and foreign keys.

#### Example: Employee and Department Tables

##### Creating the Department Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE Department (
    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DepartmentName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE
);
```

##### Creating the Employee Table with a Foreign Key Relationship

```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Email VARCHAR(100),
    DepartmentID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Department(DepartmentID)
);
```

#### Explanation

- **`DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY`**: Sets `DepartmentID` as the primary key in the `Department` table.
- **`FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Department(DepartmentID)`**: Establishes a relationship between `Employee` and `Department`.

#### Mermaid Diagram

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Employee }o--|| Department : "works in"
    Employee {
        INT EmployeeID PK
        VARCHAR FirstName
        VARCHAR LastName
        VARCHAR Email
        INT DepartmentID FK
    }
    Department {
        INT DepartmentID PK
        VARCHAR DepartmentName
    }
```

---

### 2.3 Altering Tables and Relationships

#### Adding a New Table and Establishing Relationships

##### Example: Adding a Project Table and Linking to Employee

```sql
CREATE TABLE Project (
    ProjectID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ProjectName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

-- Associative Table for Many-to-Many Relationship
CREATE TABLE EmployeeProject (
    EmployeeID INT,
    ProjectID INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (EmployeeID, ProjectID),
    FOREIGN KEY (EmployeeID) REFERENCES Employee(EmployeeID),
    FOREIGN KEY (ProjectID) REFERENCES Project(ProjectID)
);
```

#### Explanation

- **Many-to-Many Relationship**: An employee can work on multiple projects, and a project can have multiple employees.
- **Associative Table (`EmployeeProject`)**: Contains foreign keys referencing both `Employee` and `Project`.

#### Mermaid Diagram

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Employee ||--o{ EmployeeProject : "assigned to"
    Project  ||--o{ EmployeeProject : "includes"
    Employee {
        INT EmployeeID PK
        ...
    }
    Project {
        INT ProjectID PK
        VARCHAR ProjectName
    }
    EmployeeProject {
        INT EmployeeID PK, FK
        INT ProjectID PK, FK
    }
```

---

### 2.4 Dropping Tables and Databases

#### Dropping Tables with Relationships

Before dropping a table involved in relationships, you may need to drop the foreign key constraints.

##### Example

```sql
ALTER TABLE EmployeeProject
DROP FOREIGN KEY FK_EmployeeProject_Employee;

ALTER TABLE EmployeeProject
DROP FOREIGN KEY FK_EmployeeProject_Project;

DROP TABLE EmployeeProject;
DROP TABLE Employee;
DROP TABLE Project;
DROP TABLE Department;
```

---

## 3. Data Manipulation Language (DML)

DML commands are used to manage data within tables.

### 3.1 Inserting Data into Related Tables

#### Inserting Data into Parent Tables First

##### Example

```sql
-- Insert Departments
INSERT INTO Department (DepartmentID, DepartmentName)
VALUES (1, 'Human Resources'), (2, 'Engineering'), (3, 'Marketing');

-- Insert Employees
INSERT INTO Employee (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Email, DepartmentID)
VALUES
    (101, 'John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', 2),
    (102, 'Jane', 'Smith', 'jane.smith@example.com', 1),
    (103, 'Emily', 'Jones', 'emily.jones@example.com', 2);

-- Insert Projects
INSERT INTO Project (ProjectID, ProjectName)
VALUES (201, 'Project Apollo'), (202, 'Project Zeus');

-- Assign Employees to Projects
INSERT INTO EmployeeProject (EmployeeID, ProjectID)
VALUES
    (101, 201),
    (101, 202),
    (103, 201);
```

#### Explanation

- **Order of Insertion**: Insert into parent tables (`Department`, `Project`) before child tables (`Employee`, `EmployeeProject`).
- **Employee Assignments**: Employee 101 is assigned to both projects.

---

### 3.2 Updating Data Across Relationships

#### Example: Changing an Employee's Department

```sql
UPDATE Employee
SET DepartmentID = 3
WHERE EmployeeID = 103;
```

#### Explanation

- Employee 103 (`Emily Jones`) is moved to the `Marketing` department.

---

### 3.3 Deleting Data with Relationships

#### Cascading Deletes

To automatically delete related records, you can define `ON DELETE CASCADE` on foreign key constraints.

##### Example

```sql
ALTER TABLE EmployeeProject
DROP FOREIGN KEY EmployeeProject_ibfk_1;

ALTER TABLE EmployeeProject
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_EmployeeProject_Employee
FOREIGN KEY (EmployeeID)
REFERENCES Employee(EmployeeID)
ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

#### Deleting an Employee

```sql
DELETE FROM Employee
WHERE EmployeeID = 101;
```

#### Explanation

- Deleting Employee 101 will automatically remove entries from `EmployeeProject` due to cascading delete.

---

### 3.4 Selecting Data Using Joins

#### Inner Join Example

```sql
SELECT E.FirstName, E.LastName, D.DepartmentName
FROM Employee E
INNER JOIN Department D ON E.DepartmentID = D.DepartmentID;
```

#### Result

| FirstName | LastName | DepartmentName  |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| John      | Doe      | Engineering     |
| Jane      | Smith    | Human Resources |
| Emily     | Jones    | Marketing       |

#### Explanation

- **`INNER JOIN`**: Retrieves records where there is a match in both tables.

#### Mermaid Diagram: Join Visualization

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Employee ||--|| Department : "DepartmentID"
```

---

## 4. Advanced Querying and Relationships

### 4.1 Aggregate Functions and Grouping

#### Example: Count Employees per Department

```sql
SELECT D.DepartmentName, COUNT(E.EmployeeID) AS EmployeeCount
FROM Department D
LEFT JOIN Employee E ON D.DepartmentID = E.DepartmentID
GROUP BY D.DepartmentName;
```

#### Result

| DepartmentName  | EmployeeCount |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Human Resources | 1             |
| Engineering     | 1             |
| Marketing       | 1             |

---

### 4.2 Subqueries and Nested Queries

#### Example: Find Departments with More Than One Employee

```sql
SELECT DepartmentName
FROM Department
WHERE DepartmentID IN (
    SELECT DepartmentID
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY DepartmentID
    HAVING COUNT(EmployeeID) > 1
);
```

#### Explanation

- **Subquery**: The inner query calculates departments with more than one employee.

---

### 4.3 Complex Joins and Relationships

#### Example: Retrieve Employees and Their Projects

```sql
SELECT E.FirstName, E.LastName, P.ProjectName
FROM Employee E
JOIN EmployeeProject EP ON E.EmployeeID = EP.EmployeeID
JOIN Project P ON EP.ProjectID = P.ProjectID;
```

#### Result

| FirstName | LastName | ProjectName    |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| John      | Doe      | Project Apollo |
| John      | Doe      | Project Zeus   |
| Emily     | Jones    | Project Apollo |

---

## 5. Transactions and Data Integrity

#### Example: Transferring an Employee Between Projects

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Remove from current project
DELETE FROM EmployeeProject
WHERE EmployeeID = 103 AND ProjectID = 201;

-- Add to new project
INSERT INTO EmployeeProject (EmployeeID, ProjectID)
VALUES (103, 202);

COMMIT;
```

#### Explanation

- **Atomicity**: Ensures both operations succeed together.

---

## 6. Indexes, Constraints, and Relationships

### Creating Indexes to Improve Query Performance

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_DepartmentName ON Department (DepartmentName);
CREATE INDEX idx_EmployeeLastName ON Employee (LastName);
```

### Adding Constraints for Data Integrity

```sql
ALTER TABLE Employee
ADD CONSTRAINT chk_Email CHECK (Email LIKE '%@%.%');

ALTER TABLE EmployeeProject
ADD CONSTRAINT pk_EmployeeProject PRIMARY KEY (EmployeeID, ProjectID);
```

---

## 7. Stored Procedures and Functions

#### Example: Stored Procedure to Get Employee Projects

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmployeeProjects (IN empID INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT E.FirstName, E.LastName, P.ProjectName
    FROM Employee E
    JOIN EmployeeProject EP ON E.EmployeeID = EP.EmployeeID
    JOIN Project P ON EP.ProjectID = P.ProjectID
    WHERE E.EmployeeID = empID;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

#### Calling the Stored Procedure

```sql
CALL GetEmployeeProjects(101);
```

---

## 8. Triggers and Automatic Relationships Maintenance

#### Example: Trigger to Log Deletions

```sql
CREATE TABLE EmployeeDeletionLog (
    EmployeeID INT,
    DeletionDate DATETIME,
    Reason VARCHAR(255)
);

DELIMITER //

CREATE TRIGGER trg_EmployeeDeletion
AFTER DELETE ON Employee
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO EmployeeDeletionLog (EmployeeID, DeletionDate, Reason)
    VALUES (OLD.EmployeeID, NOW(), 'Employee record deleted');
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

#### Explanation

- **Trigger**: Automatically logs when an employee is deleted.

---

## 9. Views and Virtual Tables

#### Example: Creating a View for Employee Details

```sql
CREATE VIEW EmployeeDetails AS
SELECT E.EmployeeID, E.FirstName, E.LastName, D.DepartmentName
FROM Employee E
LEFT JOIN Department D ON E.DepartmentID = D.DepartmentID;
```

#### Querying the View

```sql
SELECT * FROM EmployeeDetails;
```

---

## 10. Normalization and Database Design

### First Normal Form (1NF)

- **Eliminate Repeating Groups**: Ensure each field contains atomic values.

### Second Normal Form (2NF)

- **Eliminate Redundant Data**: Remove data that applies to multiple rows.

### Third Normal Form (3NF)

- **Eliminate Columns Not Dependent on Primary Key**: Ensure all attributes depend only on the primary key.

#### Example: Normalizing an Order System

##### Initial Unnormalized Table

| OrderID | CustomerName | ProductID | ProductName | Quantity |
|---------|--------------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| 1       | Alice Smith  | 101       | Widget      | 5        |
| 1       | Alice Smith  | 102       | Gizmo       | 2        |
| 2       | Bob Johnson  | 103       | Thingamajig | 1        |

##### Normalized Tables
